<h1>On and Around Campus:</h1>

<br>

If you are looking for a place to eat on Campus, your options are admittedly a bit limited. Current food options include:

<ul>
  <li><a href= "https://ucen.ucsb.edu/" target = "_blank">The UCen (University Center):</a> The UCen is the main on-campus center, functioning much like a
  Student Union Building. In addition to housing the University Bookstore, it also houses a few food options including: Panda Express, Root,
  Jamba Juice, Subway, and Santorini Island Grill. The dining-specific page of the UCen can be found <a href = "https://ucen.ucsb.edu/dining" target = "_blank">here</a>,</li>

  <br>

  <li><a href= "https://dining.ucsb.edu/eateries-markets" target = "_blank">On-Campus "Markets:"</a> There are also a handful of "Markets" located throughout Campus. The main
  such establishment is <b>The Arbor</b>, which conveniently is the closest establishment to South Hall (where the PSTAT department is housed). The Arbor
  stocks snaks and drinks, and also houses a Subway along with a Woodstock's Pizza location around the corner. </li>

  <br>

  <li><b><u>The Hot Dog Cart:</u></b></a> Official sources list this as <i>Die Brezel</i> (German for "the Pretzel"), though you will often hear this colloquially referred to
  as "The Hot Dog Cart." One of the perhaps most underrated establishments on campus, this cart offers fresh-baked pretzels and hotdogs (with vegetarian options as well!),
  and is located just outside The Arbor.</li>

  <br>

  <li><b><u>Yoshinoya:</u></b> The only Japanese-themed eatery on campus, the UCSB branch of <i>Yoshinoya</i> (which is admittedly a chain) is located in the Courtyard Café,
  near the Physics building. Though perhaps a bit far from South Hall, the food is usually worth the trek!</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

There are a few more options off-Campus, in the city of Isla Vista. Some highlights in IV include:

<ul>
  <li><b><u>Cajé:</u></b> Cajé is a moderately-sized coffee shop, offering smoothies and smoothie bowls along with bagels (and, of course, your typical spread of café beverages:
    their Matcha Latté's are quite good!) Tere are only limited power outlets, though, so be aware of that if you are planning on studying for a while!</li>

    <br>

  <li><b><u>IV Drip:</u></b> The IV Drip is open fairly late, and boasts some of the <b>best</b> cookies around. (Several officers of this committee can personally attest!)</li>

    <br>

  <li><b><u>Phở Bistro:</u></b> If you're looking for fairly large portions at fairly decent prices, Phở Bistro is the place to go!</li>

      <br>

  <li><b><u>Woodstocks:</u></b> Woodstocks Pizza is well-known among UCSB students. Though quite pricey, their pizzas are quite good, featuring thick crusts and copious toppings.
   Woodstocks also sports a modest array of beers, making it a popular haunt among graduate students. On Thursday Nights they also host a Trivia Night at 9pm.</li>

   <br>

  <li><b><u>Freebirds:</u></b> Freebirds is fairly typical when it comes to Chipotle-style mexican restaurants (in the sense that food is made right in front of you), though
  Freebirds has the added benefit of being open fairly late (for IV) on most nights.</li>

  <br>

 <li><b><u>Blenders in the Grass:</u></b> A fairly common Smoothie/Juice-Bar chain, serving up decent smoothies and bowls for the slightly more health-conscious.</li>

   <br>

  <li><b><u>Various Others!</u></b> This list is by no means comprehensive!</li>

</ul>
