title: "Santa Barbara"
---


Though Isla Vista is the closest township to UCSB, it is admittedly a bit limited in what it offers. As such, it is fairly common for UCSB students to venture out to downtown Santa Barbara, either by car (12 minutes) or by bus (30 minutes via the 24X, 1hr via the 11).

There are (roughly) four distinct areas in Santa Barbara: State Street (sometimes called Lower State Street), Upper State Street, the Funk Zone, and the Mission. State Street boasts the most activities, both in terms of day-life and nightlife, whereas the Funk Zone excels primarily in its unique nighlife scene.
